# NewTabExtension

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.2.7.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Supabase Cloud Sync Setup

The backup UI in the dashboard expects a `public.backups` table in Supabase.

To create it:

1. Open the Supabase project linked by your `.env` file.
2. Go to SQL Editor.
3. Run the SQL in `supabase/setup-backups.sql`.

Notes:

- The current app uses the publishable key only. The included SQL allows the `anon` role to read and write backups so the extension works without user authentication.
- That means anyone with your project's publishable key can access the shared backup row. If you want private per-user backups, add Supabase Auth and replace the anonymous policies with authenticated user-scoped RLS policies.
